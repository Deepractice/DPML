# Quick Start

Get started with DPML in 5 minutes.

## Installation

Install the DPML CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g dpml
```

Or use with npx (no installation required):

```bash
npx dpml --version
```

## Your First Agent

### 1. Create a DPML File

Create a file named `travel-assistant.dpml`:

```xml
<agent>
  <llm
    api-type="openai"
    api-key="@env:OPENAI_API_KEY"
    api-url="https://api.openai.com/v1"
    model="gpt-4"/>

  <prompt>
## Role
You are a travel planner specializing in Zhangjiajie tourism.
You help customers plan their trips to Zhangjiajie.

## Skills
- Recommend attractions
- Plan itineraries
- Suggest accommodations
- Provide travel tips
  </prompt>
</agent>
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the same directory:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
```

### 3. Start Chatting

```bash
dpml agent chat travel-assistant.dpml --env-file .env
```

You should see an interactive chat prompt:

```
ðŸ¤– Travel Assistant ready. Type 'exit' to quit.

You: Hello! I want to visit Zhangjiajie next month.
Assistant: Great choice! Zhangjiajie is beautiful...
```

## Understanding the Code

Let's break down what each part does:

```xml
<agent>
  <!-- LLM configuration -->
  <llm
    api-type="openai"           <!-- Which LLM provider -->
    api-key="@env:OPENAI_API_KEY" <!-- API key from environment -->
    model="gpt-4"/>             <!-- Which model to use -->

  <!-- System prompt -->
  <prompt>
    You are a travel planner...
  </prompt>
</agent>
```

### Environment Variable References

The `@env:` prefix tells DPML to read from environment variables:

```xml
api-key="@env:OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

This is safer than hardcoding sensitive information.
